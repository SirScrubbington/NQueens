## An implementation of several local search algorithms for solving the N Queens problem
### Created by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington))

## Description
Repository for my solution to the N Queens problem, using Local Search algorithms and implemented using Java. The following algorithms have been implemented.

1. Single Hill-Climbing Algorithm
2. Random Restart Hill-Climbing Algorithm
3. Simulated Annealing Algorithm
4. Genetic Algorithm

This application was created for an artificial intelligence subject in my second
year of university in 2017. As such, it is a legacy repository which will no longer
be developed or updated.
